## A Quick Note for Gitflow
> Though this repository did not use Gitflow Workflow. here's some note about it for myself.
> Gitflow Workflow is a Git workflow that helps with continuous software development. The Gitflow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. This provides a robust framework for managing larger projects. 
* Master branch
* Develop branch
* Hotfix branch
* Release branch
* Feature branch
